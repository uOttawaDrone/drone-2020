  * Battery comes with no charger
  * Solid works going to be hard for newbies because of small
    * Provide template for design to those who need

## Next Steps
    
* Get charger: Tattu 650mAh 75C
* Get adapters for motor to board
* Start design on solidworks
* Screwdrive
* Design interface for connections
* Look at 300 mAh
